Impulse Classification Network (ICN) for video Head Impulse Test

This research proposes the Impulse Classification Network (ICN) using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) that able to detect noisy data and classify human VOR impulses. ICN is a high-performance classification method that works on a patient's video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) impulse data by identifying abnormalities and artifacts. Our ICN method found actual classes of patientâ€™s impulses with 95% accuracy.
