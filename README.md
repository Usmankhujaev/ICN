Impulse Classification Network (ICN) for video Head Impulse Test

The Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a dynamic system of the human brain which helps to maintain balance and stabilizing clear vision during head movement. The video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) is a clinical test which uses lightweight, high-speed video goggle to examine VOR function’s normality or abnormality calculating the ratio of the eye and head movement velocity. The main problem of the patient's vHIT is a data coming from goggle may have artifacts and other noises. This paper proposes the Impulse Classification Network (ICN) using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) that able to detect noisy data and classify human VOR impulses. Our ICN method found actual classes of patient’s impulses with 95% accuracy.
